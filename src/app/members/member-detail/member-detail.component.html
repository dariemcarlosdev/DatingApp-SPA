  <!-- If I donÂ´t use this property as optional, I get an error "type of undefine"
  cuz the component is loading before the data member was received, and component say
  "I dont have this data I'm going to spit out an error". That is the reason I use the safe navgation operator
  to evoid the error in the console.
